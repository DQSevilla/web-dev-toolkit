# WDT (Web Development Toolkit)
###### View our site on computers, phones or tablets [here](https://cheeseypi.github.io/web-dev-toolkit/public/index.html)
## About
Our site is meant to serve as an aid to students or independent learners looking
to learn about web developement. What our page offers is a centralized place for
people to find tools, resources and tutorials, geared specifically towards aspiring
developers. Much of the content from CS 146: Introduction to Web Development and 
Project Management is included in this site.

## Project Structure
All images and other resource files are stored in the files folder and subfolders.
All JavaScript, front end or back end, are stored in a seperate js folder. Any
CSS stlye sheets are in a css folder, and all of the publicly displayed HTML documents
are in the public folder. Our homepage is [index.html](public/index.html)

## Functionalities
**Calculators:** Our calculators page currently features a base conversion calculator,
which supports base 2, 8, 10 and 16. There were plans for a fully featured networking
calculator with support for IPv4 to IPv6, subnet count, and host per subnet count
functionalitites. This may be implemented in the future.

**Tutorials and Resources:** Our website includes tutorial pages for networking and
project management (yet incomplete) and a page of resources and links to external pages
and documents for learning front end web development.

**Search:** A last minute addition was an elementary search functionality as an alternate
way to navitage between pages, which might be enhanced in the future.

## Technologies Used
Our website incorperates HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We wanted to ensure that the website
followed responsive web design principals, which we acomplished using media queries and
smart design decisions.
