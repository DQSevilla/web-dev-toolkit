        <h3>The Team</h3>
        Each of our team members were selected at random to create this project. We each have
        different paths we plan on taking and different goals for our lives. Coming together, we
        have expanded our horizons and worked as peers and end as friends. We are all exceptionally
        knoledgable and, by putting our heads together, have made up for each of our shortcomings
        and have produced this masterpiece.
        <br>
        <h3>The Idea</h3>
        In the time we have spent in this class, every student has witnessed and experienced hardships
        with some of the material in this course. Everything from a long and tedious task, a 
        problem as easily comprehensible as Latin, or just plain not understanding content.
        The four of us decided to make a place, coming from each of our strengths and knowledge,
        that will help not only our group, but other students in our class and in other classes
        in the future.
        <br>
        <h3>The Execution</h3>
        Bringing together an idea to help us and our peers develop knowledge was the easy part.
        Figuring out what each of us knew and did not know was the tougher part. We each found,
        through conversation and the execution of the project, our greatest strengths and our
        hardest challenges. Out of the four of us, two were exceptional at programming, and the
        others really broke down the concepts outside of the programming. We learned from each
        other and all worked in every area to get this project done, and with the different
        stregths we have all brought to this project, we have achieved our goal of helping each
        other, and hope that our information helps you as well.
